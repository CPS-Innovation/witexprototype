          Confirmation of unpaid day off work

        <p>We may need to check that you have lost money from taking an unpaid day off work. </p>
         <p>To prove this you can give us your employers details. We may ask them to confirm the amount you are paid.</p>
         <p>If you would rather not do this, you can upload proof that you took time off work to go to court - for instance by uploading paylsips for the time you were off work and previous periods to show the difference. </p>
